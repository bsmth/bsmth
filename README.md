# Brian Smith (@bsmth) here ðŸ‘‹

:fox_face: I'm a Staff Technical Writer at Mozilla on the [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) team where I document web platform technologies.
If you would like to contribute to the MDN content, see the [MDN Content repo](https://github.com/mdn/content).

[MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/content) is an open-source, collaborative project that documents web platform technologies, including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web APIs.
MDN serves 13,711 pages of documentation (and 43,000 pages of localized content) to approximately 15 million monthly visitors who want to learn how the web works.

MDN's mission is to provide a blueprint for a better internet and empower a new generation of developers and content creators to build it.
